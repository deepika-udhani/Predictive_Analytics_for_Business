* To create this document, first copy and paste the full text here into a .Do document (a STATA Do-File).
* Below each question, write the code you used to answer the question
* Next, write your actual answer to the question by commenting out your writing (by starting the line with a *)

sum fico dti if loan_status==1

*4. Estimate the Mean/SD of FICO scores and Debt-to-Income for bad loans

sum fico dti if loan_status==0

*5. Estimate the Probability density for FICO of 720 conditional on the loan is good
* Save the estimate as a new variable

*disp normalden(720, 697.38, 32.85)

gen normal_FICO_good = normalden(720, 697.38, 32.85)

* gen normal_FICO_good = normalden (720, 697.38, 32.85) can do this in this manner as well

*9. Estimate the probability a loan is good using the Training Data:
* Save the estimate as a new variable

sum loan_status
egen good = mean(loan_status)

* why mean cause its only zeros and ones which would sume up to 1

*10. Estimate the Conditional probability of a good loan given a FICO=720 and dti=25

gen x = normal_FICO_good*normal_DTI_good*good

gen y = normal_FICO_bad*normal_DTI_bad*(1-good)

disp x/(x+y)
