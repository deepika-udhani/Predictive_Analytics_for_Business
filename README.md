# Predictive_Analytics_for_Business
The coursework in STATA involved a structured approach to data analysis, with a focus on informing strategic decision-making. Each project was designed to enhance our understanding of how data analysis can be applied practically to inform business strategy.

Introduction to STATA: Provided a foundational understanding of the STATA software, essential for conducting data analysis.
Data management in STATA: Taught techniques for organizing and managing large datasets efficiently, crucial for extracting meaningful insights.
Forecasting future trends in time and panel series: Explored methods for predicting future trends using time-series and panel data analysis, essential for anticipating market dynamics.
K nearest Neighbor: Introduced a machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks, enabling us to make data-driven predictions.
Logistic regression: Studied a statistical method for analyzing relationships between variables and predicting outcomes, valuable for decision-making in various contexts.
Naive Bayes Classifier: Explored another machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, helping us understand how to categorize data based on probabilities.
Overfitting and regularization: Investigated techniques for avoiding overfitting in predictive models, ensuring the reliability of our analyses.
Overall, these projects equipped us with the analytical tools and practical experience needed to leverage data effectively in decision-making processes, aligning with the course's objective of optimizing information utilization for strategic purposes.
